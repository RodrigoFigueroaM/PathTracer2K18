# PathTracer2K18

A quick implementation of a pathtracer using Monte Carlo Integration to tackle global illumination.
I made this to have a better understading of the algorithms behind a conventional Ray tracer and a Path tracer.

## Sample picture is 750 samples per pixel.

Of course it could use a clean up and better structure of files but as I said this is just a quick implementation
